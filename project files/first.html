  <h3>OUR SERVICES</h3>
<h2>Orthopatics</h2>

<p>We are specialized in upper and lower limbs surgery (wounds, fracture, carpal tunnel release and Morton neuroma …), joint replacement (shoulder, knee and hip replacement) as well spinal surgery ( fracture, stenosis and arthrodesis). We fix bone deformities in children, using braces to straighten the child's bones.
We treat sports related injuries, strains , sprains, dislocations as well ligament and tendon rupture.

Our general surgeon encompasses a full range of emergency and elective inpatient and day case surgery. He is expert in his field and provides patients with comprehensive, compassionate pre- and post-operative care, offers a wide range of investigations and treatment for benign and malignant surgical diseases with specific sub-speciality interests in upper and lower gastrointestinal surgery, as well as a range of interventions to treat diseases of the biliary systems, and endocrine (thyroid) surgery.
Our doctor tailors treatment to the patient’s individual needs; Using the latest techniques and technologies, he evaluates, treats and manages diseases or injuries that require elective or immediate surgery.
From complex to routine surgeries, our surgeon strives to make a difference in our patients’ lives.
In many cases, he can use noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques to diagnose disease. By using these techniques, he is able to diagnose potentially life-threatening conditions--such as cancer--quickly, accurately, and with little or no need for invasive surgery.
Minimally invasive procedures offer several benefits when compared to conventional surgery, including:
Less pain
Faster recovery
Less scarring
Less injury to tissue
Shorter hospital stays </p>
